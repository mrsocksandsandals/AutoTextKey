<h1 align="center">AutoTextKey</h1>
<h3 align="center">A simple Minecraft mod that adds a hotkey to type text for you.</h3>

### Usage
Download the latest `.jar` from the releases page. Then, just drop it
into your mods folder. Afterwards, launch into Minecraft and press the
`Delete` key. If you are in a world, it will type `gg` for you.

### Configuration
Open a file named `autotxt.properties` in a text editor. From there,
add a line that says `messages=$text`, where `$text` are your
messages of choice, separated by a semicolon. Save the file to `$MINECRAFT_FOLDER/config/autotxt.properties`.
Then, restart Minecraft, and the next time you use the text key, you should send
the message you set. You may also freely change all three text keybindings.
